- Version of sequential minimax/AB using move undoing instead of state copying
  (this might be a lot faster?)
- Parallel minimax w/ OpenMP
- Naive parallel AB w/ OpenMP (global AB variables)
- PVS
* Better generalized tic-tac-toe ((n,n,k) instead of (n,n,n))
* Win rate (with bounded time) testing harness
